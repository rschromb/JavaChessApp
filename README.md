# JavaChessApp

Building a beginners chess app with Java, and evolving it into a GUI model. This is very much a beginners project to relearn some of what was lost in the last year.
Feel Free to leave suggestions and comments if you care too. Always looking to learn and grow as a developer.

Much of the beginning of this project was inspired by the website https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-a-chess-game/ but I modified the program some and also added a GUI (Currently in progress).
